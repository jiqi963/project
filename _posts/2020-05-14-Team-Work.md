Our project is a team work not work along, 

# Test Bee's merge

# Solved ticket

I have finish some ticket this sprint

## Kate server

We keep credential in connect.int.php. This is our ingest file. it links TTN and database together.
After changed it will affect all running application required to transfer data to the database.

Also, we have a folder 'public' to stored those credentials
Do know why to have same files upper level the folder, need to fix(delete).

Rob has explained the relationship, and I going to delete the unuseful files.

## PHPMyAdmin

After I talk with Bee and Prasanth, there is more detail about the effect of each project:


Room sensor: We use MQTT subscription for this app so no ingest files involved. Credentials involving this project is in secrets.py file for TTN subscription keys, which will need to be updated once a semester. To update TTN Access key, visit https://console.thethings.meshed.com.au/applications/op_roomsensors and re-generate Access Keys and replace the new key in TTN_PASSWORD under op_roomsensors application.


Orokonui : sensitive information is in .env file and secrets.py. Updating phpMyAdmin password will require an update of .env file for DB access.


Co2: co2 application is currently not deployed in terms of the web application.


Kate account: Kate IoT account is where our ingest files are sitting. Updating phpMyAdmin password will require WINSCP to our kate account to update our connect.inc.php file with the updated DB information so TTN can send data to our DB server.


Will use the database however didn't deploy

I put some relative detail about server or app, also I will mention the channel and let all member know, such like 'I will change the password 2 hours late, all server and project need to update meantime'I already told bee I will do this and will try to ask more ppl work together to avoid the server down longer.
