# Access the TTN

I have updated my code let the noise monitors access the TTN, however, the payload still has some problem, it can pass data to TTN but can't show correctly at the database.

After I talk with Bee, she said my payload type incorrectly, it should be char type instead of String.

Whatever, I got an error saying `invalid conversion from 'unsigned char*' to 'char*' [-fpermissive]'`.

Not sure what's that, because Bee never saw this before. I going to ask Henry about it.

# Work From Home

I take my device and going to work at home, also I set up my computer at camps to prepare remote it from home. By the way, I can access the OP network from home, such as login to Phpmyadmin database.

# Watch dog

I have decreased some used power for room-sensor last semester, I unsolder the charge chip, even take off a small chip will affect the time when we use a battery.

Before I unsolder any unused chip from noise monitors, I going to set up a watchdog to make the device sleep.

Feather M0 can sleep deeper to save power and, I will work for watchdog and try to fix the payload around this sprint.
