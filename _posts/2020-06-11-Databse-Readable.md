## Last Ticket for me

#### Work in ingest file

[Ticket](https://gitlab.com/iotop/polykids-project/-/issues/13)

My noise's data in our Database it ascii type

![data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jiqi963/project/master/img/data1.png)

To convert ascii to decimal I found a PHP function called ord() â€” Convert the first byte of a string to a value between 0 and 255

[Function ord](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.ord.php)

I going to convert it on our ingest file on kate server.

there is a table show how to convert data type for each format

#### Work in Arduino code

Bee has similar situation when she builds the co2 sensor, the same code working in the 32u4 rather than M0 board.

I going to try the code in 32u4 when I arrived OP.

#### Result

###### Arduino node

the function 

`  String str;`

` str = String(dB);`

` str.toCharArray(payload, 3);`

can work in 32u4 and finally I converted the data to string type on Arduino node

###### TTN payload

Because I send the array to TTN, so I need to slice it by this:

`var dbSlice = String.fromCharCode.apply(null, bytes.slice(0,3));`

[THIS SITE](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_slice_array.asp) explain how slice work

###### Readable

The data is readable in the database at the moment.
