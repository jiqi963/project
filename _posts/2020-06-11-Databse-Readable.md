## Last Ticket for me

#### Work in ingest file

[Ticket](https://gitlab.com/iotop/polykids-project/-/issues/13)

My noise's data in our Database it ascii type

![data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jiqi963/project/master/img/data1.png)

To convert ascii to decimal I found a PHP function called ord() â€” Convert the first byte of a string to a value between 0 and 255

[Function ord](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.ord.php)

I going to convert it on our ingest file on kate server.

there is a table show how to convert data type for each format

Bee has similar situation when she builds the co2 sensor, the same code working in the 32u4 rather than M0 board.
