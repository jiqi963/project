# Background

I made the Noise monitors for kindergarten last time, the user only wants to know the noise and do not access the internet.

However, we are the IoT team, We should access all devices to the TTN if possible, by the way, I try to update the monitor.

## Purpose

After the monitor can access the TTN, we can collect the date and know when it is the noisiest time or when it is the quietest time.

## Board

I did some test with TTGO last semester and not seccess, I going to ues Feather M0 this semester beacuse our team ues this for some room sensor and easy to debug.
