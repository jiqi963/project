## Purpose

This is the related [ticket](https://gitlab.com/iotop/room-sensors/-/merge_requests/18)

Bee going to merge it to master branch, so I tested it on my machine.

the main different is:

- Updated python data retrieval array instead of using nested array in the previous version.
- Status is updated according to the most updated data available in database.
- Refresh page every 20 seconds instead of 30 seconds.
- Renamed gates according to type of sensors used as well as location in order to avoid confusion between testing device and deployed device.
