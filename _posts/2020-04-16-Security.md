## Device borken

I have did some test for my Feather for the watchdog function, after I tried an example, the device sleep deep and can't wake, I have try a lot of ways to wake up it, however, it's doesn't work.

I found use JLink can debugging the Arduino, also it should be able to wake up it. I have asked Vaughn about this device, hopeful we have one in our inventory.

## Start my new secure role

After my device has problem, I can't still wait for the hardware, Martin suggested me to do some security work because us repositories exposed some credentials. Such as TTN key, password etc...

Henry posted some issues, so I going to fix them one by one.

Some found issues:

- SQL DB credentials exposed in CarBonGauge.php

- IceRing node sketch was exposed in commit 'a6f2bc1c'

- TTN access key from relay.py(server repo)

- Device key from TTN_noise.ino

- Anything still uses 'P@ssw0rd'
