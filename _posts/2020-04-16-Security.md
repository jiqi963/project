After my device has problem, I can't still wait for the hardware, Martin suggested me to do some security work because your repositories exposed some credentials. Such as TTN key, password etc...

Henry posted some issues, so I going to fix them one by one.

Some found issues:

- SQL DB credentials exposed in CarBonGauge.php

- IceRing node sketch was exposed in commit 'a6f2bc1c'

- TTN access key from relay.py(server repo)

- Device key from TTN_noise.ino

- Anything still uses 'P@ssw0rd'
